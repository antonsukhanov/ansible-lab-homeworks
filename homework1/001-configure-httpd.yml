# Note, that usage of firewalld services may mean several ports.
# Specify required ports manually instead if necessary.
#
# Note, that lab environment set by Vagrantfile has firewalld service
# disabled by default. We enable firewalld service in this playbook,
# but this operation may be dangerous on production environment.
# In that case we should better check if firewalld service is set 
# to enabled and than manage ports access.
